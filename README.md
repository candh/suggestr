### Where does the movies come from? ‚òÅÔ∏è
The movies are added in a array, by hand, but not the metadata of them, Just the names! That is imported from a 3rd party API. The API will be credited.

### Contribution üñ•
Add a movie to the array

    vi tools/movie-list.js

Run this script to add the movie to the `movies.json` file found in the db folder

    node tools/movie-list-maker.js

The user data is stored on a mongodb on the cloud.

- [API AI](https://api.ai/) for the AI I wanted. Tried to write my own, but when users grew, uncertainty among their queries also grew. Couldn't handle it. Thanks to them. Amazing work.

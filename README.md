A facebook movie üé¨ suggesting bot

[See it in action](https://vimeo.com/197744845)

### Status ‚úÖ
Its up and running! Try it

[m.me/movie.suggester](https://m.me/movie.suggester)

### Where does the movies come from? ‚òÅÔ∏è
The movies are added in a array, by hand, but not the metadata of them, Just the names! That is imported from a 3rd party API. The API will be credited.

### Contribution üñ•
Add a movie to the array

    vi tools/movie-list.js

~~Run this script to add the movie to the `movies.json` file found in the db folder~~

    node tools/movie-list-maker.js

**This will not work** anymore since the API now requires an access token. So you'll just have to submit a pull request with the updated `movie-list.js` (and/or other features that you want) and I'll update the `db/movies.json` myself.
